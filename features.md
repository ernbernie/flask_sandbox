### Prefixed Text in Prayer Input Field
- **Objective**: Ensure "Dear Heavenly Father," is permanently affixed at the start of every prayer in the input field.

  1. Use a `contenteditable` solution with a fixed span for the prefix.
  2. Use JavaScript to dynamically append and lock the prefix.
  3. Explore CSS-only solutions for immutable prefix styling.
- **Status**: To be implemented later.
- **Priority**: Medium
